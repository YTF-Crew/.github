# Welcome to the YTF Crew Organization!
This organization is purely based off the YTF: Reuploaded OC modification to indie game [Friday Night Funkin'](https://ninja-muffin24.itch.io/funkin). With a friend group being the main weeks. And freeplay songs being purely for fun.
## Background
The mod group was initially founded by [EthanBloxFNF.](https://www.youtube.com/@EthanVGamer) After the mod was canned/cancelled, Ethan tried to bring the mod back as "YTF: Rebranded" but ended up also getting cancelled, Linkwaree was one of the Co-Owners of the first mod and looking at the nostalgia decided to bring it back for the third time.
## Contact
The YTF Crew currently has two owners, [Linkwaree](https://github.com/linkwaree)  and [EthanBloxFNF,](https://github.com/EthanBloxFNF)
We also work with many talented developers who work on the mod (who are all credited in-game)
